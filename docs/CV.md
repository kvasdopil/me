**Full Stack / Mobile / IoT / Embedded Linux Developer / AI fanboy**

For me, building software for the last 20 years has been about one thing: creative problem-solving. My real strength is connecting the dots between different fields‚ÄîIoT, mobile, AI, and backend‚Äîto find innovative solutions others might miss. I genuinely enjoy the process of taking a project from a "what if" idea to a real-world product, and I'm very comfortable working through the many unknowns to get there efficiently. I love to learn, tinker, and ultimately, ship great work.
