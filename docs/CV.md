**Full Stack / Mobile / IoT / Embedded Linux Developer / AI fanboy**

For me, building software for the last 20 years has been about one thing: creative problem-solving. My real strength is connecting the dots between different fields-IoT, mobile, AI, and backend-to find innovative solutions others might miss. I genuinely enjoy the process of taking a project from a "what if" idea to a real-world product, and I'm very comfortable working through the many unknowns to get there efficiently. I love to learn, tinker, and ultimately, ship great work.

## Work Experience

### Instabee, Stockholm - _Full Stack Developer_

**2025 – current**

Parcel delivery to lockers. Best and biggest in Nordics.

- Built and maintained internal tools for monitoring and managing a large device fleet.
  > When I started, just to get a sense of what's going on I've built a small dashboard with all the parcel lockers we managed. It showed them on a map, had some filters, search, historical values and basic reports. Nothing fancy - just a quick experiment so I could get a grip on things and understand how APIs are wired together.
  > Turns out, the team really liked it. They had been discussing a similar idea for years but couldn’t get it moving past the meetings. My little prototype unblocked the project, and together we started shaping it into a proper fleet management dashboard. It wasn’t just about the tool - it was about showing how a simple experiment can spark collaboration and get everyone moving in the same direction.
  > For me, this project wasn’t only about solving a problem, but also about showing the value of quick iterations and side projects. I like bringing people along, building momentum, and proving that even small ideas can turn into something the whole team is proud of.
  > The project was done in `TypeScript` for `next.js`, using `maplibre` for map rendering. A small `psql` database to keep historical data. Deployments done with `gh actions`, `helm` and `terraform` to `k8s` cluster on `gcp`. Most of the development was done in `cursor`.
- Expanded and optimized geospatial services ahead of launch in a new international market.
  > Oh I love that one!
  > So, I was assigned to temporarily take ownership of an abandoned geospatial ranking service right before launch in a new market. The tool, and service, was used to rank parcel lockers by proximity to the customer, but a lot of work was done manually and the results weren’t too accurate or consistent, so we faced a mountain of manual work if nothing changed.
  > I've took the initiative to use routing data from OpenStreetMap and automate things, which immediately improved both accuracy and reliability. The changes were deliberately non-intrusive - fully backward-compatible, no backend modifications required, and no extra risks introduced during a critical launch window.
  > This work unblocked the development, saved the team a lot of time, and gave stakeholders confidence that the launch could move forward. It also set the foundation for future improvements without creating technical debt.
  > I've also built a simple visualisation UI to visualize the results, which turned out to be essential during the validation phase of the project.
  > Later, once things calmed down, another team took over ownership - and they were happy to inherit a service that was stable, useful, and already making progress.
  > The service was running in `go`, additional data processing performed in `python` using data from `OpenStreetMap` and `OSRM`. Front-end done in `next.js`, `TypeScript`, using `maplibre`. Most of the development was done in `cursor`.
